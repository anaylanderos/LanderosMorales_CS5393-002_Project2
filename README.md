# Sentiment Analysis Project
CS5393-002 Project 2
Author: Anay Landeros Morales
Project Description:
The Sentiment Analysis project implements a classifier that determines whether tweets express positive or negative sentiment using natural language processing techniques. The system trains on a dataset of pre-classified tweets by analyzing word frequencies to identify patterns associated with different emotional expressions. After training, the classifier can predict sentiment in new tweets by evaluating the presence of words that commonly appear in positive versus negative contexts. The implementation features a custom string class (DSString) that manages dynamic memory allocation.
